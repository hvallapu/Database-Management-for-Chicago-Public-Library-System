Chicago Public library is an enormous collection of books and it is the responsibility of any librarian to manage the record details of books that are published to the public and returned to the librarian. From this project we can obtain the entire data sheet of the particular library scheme to assist the library employees keep each book detail in order to prevent any other missing records. The first step to estimate the no.of tables required in their database (books, customers, staffs etc.) after the normalization, the tables need to be split and arranged for simple access accordingly. Then we can create/initialize the database, update, delete or insert it. The main purpose of the project is to analyze the tables and create an E-R[model] diagram to create a database that the programmers and authorized users can easily use.


# ðŸ“š Database Management for Chicago Public Library System


A simple library management system with PHP and MySQL.
This is a school project so it lacks most of the features that a fully-fledged management system might have. Everything is kept at a very basic level. So, I reckon, it will not be used by anyone.



## Features
* A login page with captcha
* Dashboard
* Book management
* Member management
* Borrowed Books

## Installation

Copy the project folder to your preferred Apache server's host folder.
For Xampp, I use ```htdocs```.

You can then import the ```library_db.sql``` script or run it as a query which should create the database and insert some data. 

After checking and adjusting ports and login info on ```config.php``` you should be ready to launch the project.

Login credentials are ```admin``` and ```admin```.
